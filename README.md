# Musort

Ogranize your music library. A Python3 program that renames all selected music/audio files in a folder with a specified naming convention. Names are generated from the metadata (ID3) from the audio files. Before using this program, use a metadata editor like MusicBrainz Picard, Beets or EasyTAG to add the correct metadata to the audio files.

## Features

* Rename many audio files at once
* Rename all files in subdirectories as well (recursive)
* Choose the naming convention (ex. track.title.flac or artist.track.year.mp3)
* Give a separator for the naming of the file (ex. track.title.flac or track_title.flac)
* Works on all systems that can run Python
* Supported audio formats  
  * MP3/MP2/MP1 (ID3 v1, v1.1, v2.2, v2.3+)
  * Wave/RIFF
  * OGG
  * OPUS
  * FLAC
  * WMA
  * MP4/M4A/M4B/M4R/M4V/ALAC/AAX/AAXC
  * AIFF/AIFF-C

## Dependencies
**Note: When using the install script, TinyTag will be automatically installed**

- [TinyTag](https://pypi.org/project/tinytag/) (Installable from Python Package Index)
## Installation and Usage

### Method 1: Run installation script (Unix/Linux based OS only)
The installation script will move the python program to `~/.local/bin`. Make sure that `~/.local/bin` exists and that is added to $PATH.

cd Musort.git
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```
After that, simply use the command `musort` to use the program.
### Method 2: Clone repo and run manually (All Operating Systems)
Clone the repository and run the Python program
``` Bash
git clone https://github.com/tdeerenberg/Musort.git
cd Musort
pip install requirements.txt
```
After that, run the program with `python3 musort.py`.
